# Recommended compute for a miner
Highly depends on what it is you want to run, which models etc. I'd recommend doing some research into the models and some experiements.

As a rule of thumb;

| Model Type               | VRAM Requirement |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Llama 70B & Mixtral-8x7B | >=50GB           |
| Image generation models  | ~8GB             |
