**Vision LLM inference server**

**WARNING: The LLM server is now only for the validator to use. Please use the same schema as base VLLM
in order to run your miners :)***


BUT please use a base image from August, as the September update seems to be not compatible as it sends an empty token
at the end with 'None' for logprobs.
